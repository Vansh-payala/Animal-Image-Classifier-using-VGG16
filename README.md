# Animal-Image-Classifier-using-VGG16

Project Overview:

This project focuses on building a deep learning-based image classification model to categorize images of animals into 10 classes using a pre-trained VGG16 model. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of animal images and achieves high accuracy by leveraging transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.


Objective:

The primary goal is to:

Classify animal images into 10 categories: pecora (sheep), mucca (cow), gatto (cat), gallina (chicken), farfalla (butterfly), elefante (elephant), cavallo (horse), cane (dog), scoiattolo (squirrel), ragno (spider).
Implement a deep learning pipeline using VGG16 as the backbone for feature extraction.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Dataset: Animals-10 Dataset on Kaggle

The dataset contains 10 classes of animal images, with variations in size, orientation, and quality.

Technologies Used:

1) Python for programming.
2) TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning.
3) VGG16 pre-trained model for transfer learning.
4) NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation.
5) Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations.
