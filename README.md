# Animal-Image-Classifier-using-VGG16

Project Overview:

This project focuses on building a deep learning-based image classification model to categorize images of animals into 10 classes using a pre-trained VGG16 model. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of animal images and achieves high accuracy by leveraging transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.


Objective: 

Classify images of animals into 10 categories using a fine-tuned VGG16 model.

Steps:
1) Data Preprocessing
2) Model Architecture
3) Training Details (epochs, accuracy, etc.)
4) Results (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, etc.)
